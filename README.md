# Morphological Complexity from WALS

This repository contains a reproduction of the language morphological complexity values from [Bentz et al. (2016)](http://www.christianbentz.de/Papers/Bentz%20et%20al.%20(2016)%20Morphological%20complexity%20measures.pdf).
It employs the method in the paper (which returns slightly different values from those reported), and furthermore contains values for all languages in WALS that have at least one included feature.
